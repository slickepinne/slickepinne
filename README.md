## Hej gorgeous people ðŸŒ»

I like [regular expressions](https://dev.to/codegram/understanding-regular-expressions-once-and-for-all-part-1-2g4g), dogs and learning new things â€“ not necessarily in this order.

I'm a Senior Software Engineer at [Grover](https://www.grover.com/es-en) â€“ if you love tech and shareconomy, Grover definitely should be on your agenda! Previously, I worked at [Codegram](https://codegram.com) where I was involved in building an Elections module for the participatory democracy framework [@decidim](https://github.com/decidim/decidim) - check it out, it's **open-source**. Also, I started experimenting with [ink](https://github.com/inkle/ink) to create small games.

In my free time, I teach my two adorable dogs, Hugo and Ona, silly tricks. I also enjoy cooking plant-based recipes and playing games Ã  la 'Life is Strange', 'Heavy Rain', 'Beyond: Two Souls', 'RÃ¶ki' or 'Don't starve together'.
