## Hej gorgeous people ðŸŒ»

I like [regular expressions](https://dev.to/codegram/understanding-regular-expressions-once-and-for-all-part-1-2g4g), dogs and learning new things â€“ not necessarily in this order.

Since July '22, I'm part of a wonderful diverse team at [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com/). You surely know them, but if not, read the [blog](https://thoughtbot.com/blog), carve your skills with [upcase](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/) or use and contribute to any of the amazing [open source projects](https://github.com/thoughtbot).

Previously, I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at [Grover](https://www.grover.com/es-en) and [Codegram](https://codegram.com). In the latter, I was involved in building an Elections module for the participatory democracy framework [@decidim](https://github.com/decidim/decidim) - check it out, it's **open-source**.

In my free time, I teach my two adorable dogs, Hugo and Ona, funny tricks. I also enjoy cooking plant-based recipes and playing games Ã  la 'Life is Strange', 'Heavy Rain', 'Beyond: Two Souls', 'RÃ¶ki', 'Don't starve together' and 'GRIS'. Sometimes, I'm experimenting with [ink](https://github.com/inkle/ink) to create small games. My latest non-technical project is converting a Renault Master into a campervan to experience the world on 4 wheels.
