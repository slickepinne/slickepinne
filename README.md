## Hej lovely people ðŸŒ»

I like [regular expressions](https://www.codegram.com/blog/understanding-regex-once-and-for-all-part-one), dogs and creating things â€“ not necessarily in this order.

I work at [Codegram](https://codegram.com) where I was recently involved in building an Elections module for the participatory democracy framework [@decidim](https://github.com/decidim/decidim) - check it out, it's **open-source**. Also, I started experimenting with [ink](https://github.com/inkle/ink) to create small games.

In my free time, I teach my two adorable dogs, Hugo and Ona, silly tricks. I also enjoy cooking plant-based recipes and playing games Ã  la 'Life is Strange', 'Heavy Rain' or 'Beyond: Two Souls'.
